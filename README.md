# python-calculator

I am aware it is not complete or correct. Although it doesn't do what the assignment says, it taught me some valuable lessons. Like if it works then don't change it, or if I will change it then do it on a new branch. I also learned how important it is to commit frequently so I see what the code looked like when it actually worked. I will review the videos once again and see if I missed anything because I was on board with everything until the middle of the second video with unittest. Anyway thanks for the good lesson and sorry I couldn't complete it as designed!
